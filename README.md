# React Google Calendar Events List

See it in action on [The Runnin' Kind's site](http://therunninkind.com).

## Getting started:

- `npm install`
- `npm start` (will watch files for changes)
- open `index.html` in your browser. Edit `index.jsx` to make changes.

## Setting it up w/ your calendar

In the `React.renderComponent` function, set `apiKey` to your [Google API
Key](https://console.developers.google.com/project), then set `calendarId` to
your desired calendar's ID (find this from calendar.google.com -> my calendars
-> settings -> the calendar you want to map -> Calendar Address -> Calendar ID)
